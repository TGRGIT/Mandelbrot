 * Using techniques we've covered in class, accelerate the rendering of

 * 
 * Hints
 * 
 * 1) Vectorize
 * 2) Use threads
 * 3) Load Balance
 * 4) Profile and Optimise
 * 
 * Potential FAQ.
 * 
 * Q1) Why when I zoom in far while palying with the code, why does the image begin to render all blocky?
 * A1) In order to render at increasing depths we must use increasingly higher precision floats
 * 	   We quickly run out of precision with 32 bits floats. Change all floats to doubles if you want
 * 	   dive deeper. Eventually you will however run out of precision again and need to integrate an
 * 	   infinite precision math library or use other techniques.
 * 
 * Q2) Why do some frames render much faster than others?
 * A2) Frames with a lot of black, i.e, frames showing a lot of set M, show pixels that ran until the 
 *     maximum number of iterations was reached before bailout. This means more CPU time was consumed
